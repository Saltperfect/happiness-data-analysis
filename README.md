Analysis of World Happiness Report by  United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network.
You can find the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness)

Data is collected from people in over 150 countries. Each variable measured reveals a populated-weighted average score on a scale running from 0 to 10 that is tracked over time and compared against other countries. These variables currently include: real GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

In the first part of the analysis I have compared the correlation of these six variable with happiness score with Pearson correlation coefficient. Pearson correlation coefficient, also referred to as Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PPMCC), is a measure of the linear correlation between two variables X and Y. It has a value between +1 and −1, where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and −1 is total negative linear correlation. It is widely used in the sciences.

# Results concluded.
Suprisingly GDP affects the most to our happiness score followed by health, family, freedom, trust on government and lastly generosity.
Also it can be seen that we are focusing on the correct areas as correlation is increasing with years.
